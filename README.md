# WordDaze
WordDaze is a blogging application written using [Blazor](https://blazor.net) with a WebAPI backend.

Thanks to some great work by [Vincent Baaij](https://github.com/vnbaaij). There is also a Razor Components version available in the [razor-components-example](https://github.com/chrissainty/worddaze/tree/razor-components-example) branch.

This repo accompanies a 6 part blog series available on [ChrisSainty.com](https://chrissainty.com/building-a-blogging-app-with-blazor-getting-setup).
